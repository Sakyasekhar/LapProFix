### Overview 🌟

<!-- Briefly describe the issue or area of improvement. Include key observations. -->

I’ve identified a few improvements that can enhance the consistency and collaboration within our codebase:

- [ ] Issue 1: <!-- e.g., The `.env` file is not listed in `.gitignore`, which may expose sensitive data. 🔒 -->
- [ ] Issue 2: <!-- e.g., Both `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` are included, which could cause dependency conflicts. ⚠️ Stick to one package manager. 📦 -->
